# About Me

Hi there 👋 — I’m a curious engineer who believes that *what we know is finite, but learning is infinite.*

I build, learn, and share my experiences through **nbyinfinity.dev**, a space where curiosity meets real-world engineering.  
This blog is my digital notebook — from experiments in **data engineering** and **cloud architectures** to insights from programming languages and open-source projects.

## 🧩 What I Build & Learn

I love exploring how **cloud**, **data**, and **software design** come together to solve real-world problems.

### ⚙️ Current Focus
- **S3-SQL-Search** — An open-source integration of **Snowflake** and **AWS** that brings **SQL-powered search** to S3 file metadata through a secure, Streamlit-based interface.  
- Currently diving into **system programming** and **cloud engineering** with **AWS** and **Google Cloud**, blending low-level technical understanding with large-scale distributed systems.  
- Always driven by **continuous learning**, experimenting with new technologies and refining what I’ve already mastered.

## 🏗️ What Drives nbyinfinity

> “Small in knowledge, endless in curiosity.”

*nbyinfinity* reflects a belief that learning is a never-ending journey.  
It’s a reminder that what we know is just a drop in an infinite ocean — and every drop shared helps someone else learn faster.
